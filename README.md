Among the different card types, the Blue Card stands out significantly, generating $46 million in revenue, while the Silver, Gold, and Platinum cards contribute $6 million, $2 million, and $1 million respectively. This data underscores the Blue cardholders as the primary revenue source, marking them as a vital demographic for retention and further incentives. An analysis of quarterly performance reveals that Q3 experienced the highest transaction volume, with 166,600 transactions and revenue of $14.2 million, indicating a peak in activity during this quarter. In contrast, Q1 and Q2 exhibited similar revenue patterns, while Q4 experienced a slight decline. Examining expense categories, it is evident that Bills account for the highest revenue at $14 million, followed closely by Entertainment and Fuel, each contributing $10 million.

In summary, the prevailing customer profile consists of a Graduate businessman utilizing a Blue card primarily for bill payments through swipe transactions, particularly active during the third quarter.
